#FIFO MULTICAST PROTOCOL SIMULATION

Its a personal simulation of a revisited FIFO Multicast protocol in .NET 4.7
This protocol can retrieve datas from multiple senders in the proper order.

#HOW TO RUN IT

You can run it using the sender/receiver.sh in the respective folders. 

#HOW IT WORKS

We have two instances of UDP client (sender and receiver) who the first one can send messages for each node in the network, in this particular case I set 4 nodes A,B,C,D.
The receiver in this case can retrieve all the messages from the network and order them using a buffer list where to keep future messages to send to the application.
